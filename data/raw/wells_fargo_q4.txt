◦ $(448) million, or $(0.10) per share, of net losses on debt securities related to a repositioning of the investment portfolio
Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf commented, “Let me start by acknowledging the unbelievable devastation from the Los Angeles
wildfires. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted including both our customers and employees, and we are committed to
providing support to these communities.
Turning to Wells Fargo’s performance, our solid performance this quarter caps a year of significant progress for Wells Fargo. Our earnings
profile continues to improve, we are seeing the benefit from investments we are making to increase our growth and improve how we serve
our customers and communities, we maintained a strong balance sheet, we returned approximately $25 billion of capital to shareholders,
and we made significant progress on our risk and control work.
Our diluted earnings per share increased 11% from a year ago and benefited from decisions we made to exit or scale back certain
businesses, decrease our reliance on net interest income by growing fee-based revenues, increase investments in our core businesses, and
consistently look to increase efficiencies across the company. Strong fee-based revenue growth, up 15% from a year ago, largely offset the
expected decline in net interest income. Expenses declined from a year ago, and credit trends remained relatively stable. We maintained
significant excess capital with an 11.1% CET1 ratio at year end while we repurchased approximately $20 billion of common stock during the
year, up 64% from a year ago, and increased our common stock dividend per share by 15%. Average common shares outstanding decreased
21% since the fourth quarter of 2019.”
“I’m proud of the clear progress we’ve made on our risk and control agenda. The OCC terminated a consent order it issued in 2016
regarding sales practices, an important milestone for Wells Fargo. Our operational risk and compliance infrastructure is greatly changed
from when I arrived and while we are not done, I’m confident that we will successfully complete the work required in our consent orders and
embed an operational risk and compliance mindset into our culture,” Scharf added.
“I’m excited about the opportunities ahead as we’ve seen improved results and increased market share in many of the businesses that we
believe will drive higher growth and returns over time. For example, our credit card business continues to generate strong growth while
maintaining a strong credit profile. After several years of minimal growth, we grew net checking accounts more meaningfully in 2024. We
also grew mobile active customers by 1.5 million in 2024. For our affluent clients, we are starting to see some early benefits from the
enhancements we have been making to our Wells Fargo Premier offerings, including higher deposit and investment balances. Fees and
market share from investment banking and trading activities have been growing and our revenues in both trading and investment banking
grew by double-digits in 2024, reflecting the investments we have been making in talent and technology,” Scharf continued.
“I believe we are still in the early stages of seeing the benefits of the momentum we are building, and our financial performance should
continue to benefit from the work we are doing to transform the company. I want to thank everyone who works at Wells Fargo for their
hard work over the past year and for what they do every single day to support our customers, clients, and communities.” Scharf concluded.

Fourth Quarter 2024 vs. Fourth Quarter 2023
◦ Net interest income decreased 7%, driven by deposit mix and pricing changes, the impact of lower rates on floating rate
assets, and lower loan balances, partially offset by lower market funding
◦ Noninterest income increased 11%, driven by improved results from our venture capital investments, an increase in
asset-based fees in Wealth and Investment Management on higher market valuations, and higher investment banking
fees, as well as increases in most other fee categories, partially offset by net losses on debt securities related to a
repositioning of the investment portfolio and lower net gains from trading in our Markets business
◦ Noninterest expense decreased 12%, driven by lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assessments, as
fourth quarter 2023 included a $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment, as well as lower severance expense and the impact
of efficiency initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue-related compensation expense
predominantly in Wealth and Investment Management, an increase in benefits expense, and higher technology and
equipment expense
◦ Provision for credit losses in fourth quarter 2024 included a decrease in the allowance for credit losses, reflecting lower
allowances across most loan portfolios, partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans driven by an increase in
balances
◦ Income tax expense in fourth quarter 2024 included $863 million of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of
prior period matters

off rate increased to 0.85% (annualized), up from 0.83%, due to higher net loan charge-offs in the credit card portfolio
◦ Nonperforming assets were down $448 million, or 5%, driven by lower commercial real estate nonaccrual loans,

Forward-Looking Statements
This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and our management may make forward-
looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can
be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,”
“projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular,
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial
performance of the Company or any of its businesses, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our expectations
regarding noninterest expense and our efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our
expectations regarding future loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic scenarios considered to
develop the allowance; (iv) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (v) loan growth or the
reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or targets; (vii) the expected
outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance
therewith; (viii) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (ix) our targeted
range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (x) expectations regarding our
effective income tax rate; (xi) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal actions; (xii) environmental, social and
governance related goals or commitments; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements
relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to
predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution
you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact
nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or
risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include the following, without limitation:
• current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high
unemployment rates, declines in commercial real estate prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical
matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth;
• our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;
• current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,
including rules and regulations relating to bank products and financial services;
• our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, the impact to our
balance sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements and long-term targeted capital structure, the
results of supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), regulatory and legal
considerations, including regulatory requirements under the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rule, and other factors
deemed relevant by the Company, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.
For additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
available on its website at www.sec.gov1.
Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We
undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future
developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are
unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate
calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent
difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be
significant to future results.
