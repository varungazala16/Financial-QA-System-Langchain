◦ Repurchased 112.5 million shares, or $6.1 billion, of
common stock in first quarter 2024
First quarter 2024 results included:
◦ $(284) million, or ($0.06) per share, of additional expense for the estimated FDIC special assessment5
Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf commented, “Our solid first quarter results demonstrate the progress we continue
to make to improve and diversify our financial performance. The investments we are making across the franchise
contributed to higher revenue versus the fourth quarter as an increase in noninterest income more than offset an
expected decline in net interest income. Net charge-offs were stable from the fourth quarter as credit trends remained
consistent with recent performance, and we repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock while maintaining a strong capital
position.”
“We reached an important milestone in the first quarter when the OCC announced the termination of a consent order it
issued in 2016 regarding sales practices misconduct. The closure of this order is an important step forward and is
confirmation that we operate much differently today around sales practices. It is the sixth enforcement action against
Wells Fargo that our regulators have closed since 2019. The remaining risk and control work continues to be our top
priority and we will not be satisfied until all work is complete,” Scharf added.
“We remain committed to improving our efficiency while we also invest in both core infrastructure and new products and
services to better serve our customers. In the first quarter we continued to enhance our credit card offerings with the
introduction of Autograph JourneySM, which is designed for frequent travelers. Our new products continued to drive
strong spend on our cards, and our investments in talent and technology in the Corporate and Investment Banking
businesses helped drive fee-based growth,” Scharf concluded.
1 Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and other financial assets.
2 Represents our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach, which is our binding CET1 ratio. See tables on pages 26-27 of the 1Q24
Quarterly Supplement for more information on CET1. CET1 for March 31, 2024, is a preliminary estimate.
3 Return on equity (ROE) represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders’ equity.
4 Tangible common equity and return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) are non-GAAP financial measures. For additional information, including a corresponding
reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the “Tangible Common Equity” tables on pages 24-25 of the 1Q24 Quarterly Supplement.
5 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment expense reflects an update provided by the FDIC in February 2024 on losses to the deposit insurance fund,
as well as potential recoveries expected to reduce these estimated losses.

3 The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).
First Quarter 2024 vs. First Quarter 2023
◦ Net interest income decreased 8%, due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs, including the impact of
customer migration to higher yielding deposit products, as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on
earning assets
◦ Noninterest income increased 17%, driven primarily by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on
lower impairments, higher investment banking fees, an increase in asset-based fees in Wealth and Investment
Management on higher market valuations, and higher trading revenue in our Markets business
◦ Noninterest expense increased 5%, driven by higher operating losses reflecting customer remediation accruals for
historical matters, higher FDIC assessments, an increase in revenue-related compensation predominantly in Wealth and
Investment Management, and higher technology and equipment expense, partially offset by the impact of efficiency
initiatives including lower professional and outside services expense
◦ Provision for credit losses in first quarter 2024 included a decrease in the allowance for credit losses driven by
commercial real estate and auto loans, partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans

◦ Commercial net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.25% (annualized), down from 0.34%, driven by
lower commercial real estate net loan charge-offs, predominantly in the office portfolio, partially offset by higher
commercial and industrial net loan charge-offs. The consumer net loan charge-off rate increased to 0.84% (annualized),
up from 0.79%, due to higher net loan charge-offs in the credit card portfolio, partially offset by lower net loan charge-
offs in the auto portfolio

Forward-Looking Statements
This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and our management may make forward-
looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can
be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,”
“projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular,
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial
performance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our expectations regarding noninterest expense
and our efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses,
our allowance for credit losses, and the economic scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our expectations
regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan
portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or targets; (vii) our expectations regarding our mortgage business and
any related commitments or exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative
developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future common stock dividends, common
share repurchases and other uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on
tangible common equity; (xi) expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such
as legal actions; (xiii) environmental, social and governance related goals or commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans,
objectives and strategies.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements
relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to
predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution
you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact
nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or
risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include the following, without limitation:
• current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high
unemployment rates, declines in commercial real estate prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical
matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth;
• our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;
• current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,
including rules and regulations relating to bank products and financial services;
• our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things,
litigation and regulatory matters;
• the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing
rights and mortgage loans held for sale;
• significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things,
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairment of securities held in our debt securities and equity securities
portfolios;
• the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage
and wealth management businesses;
• developments in our mortgage banking business, including any negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing,
loan modification or foreclosure practices, and any changes in industry standards, regulatory or judicial requirements,
or our strategic plans for the business;
• negative effects from instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal,
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our
reputation;
• regulatory matters, including the failure to resolve outstanding matters on a timely basis and the potential impact of
new matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines,
penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences;
-9-

--- Page 10 ---
• a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks;
• the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;
• fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board;
• changes to tax laws, regulations, and guidance as well as the effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate;
• our ability to develop and execute effective business plans and strategies; and
• the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023.
In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, the impact to our
balance sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements and long-term targeted capital structure, the
results of supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), regulatory and legal
considerations, including regulatory requirements under the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rule, and other factors
deemed relevant by the Company, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.
For additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
available on its website at www.sec.gov5.
Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We
undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future
developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are
unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate
calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent
difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be
significant to future results.
