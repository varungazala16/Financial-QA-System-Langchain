A We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (KPIs) that management uses when assessing consolidated and/or segment
results. We believe this information is useful because it provides management and investors with information about underlying operational
performance and trends. KPIs are presented in Consolidated and Business Segment Highlights on page 1, Balance Sheet, Liquidity, and Capital
Highlights on page 9 and on the Segment pages for each segment.
B We also measure NII on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business
that management believes provides investors with meaningful information on the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this
presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. NII on an FTE
basis was $13.9 billion, $14.2 billion and $14.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.
The FTE adjustment was $160 million, $158 million and $135 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023,
respectively.
C Reserve Build (or Release) is calculated by subtracting net charge-offs for the period from the provision for credit losses recognized in that period.
The period-end allowance, or reserve, for credit losses reflects the beginning of the period allowance adjusted for net charge-offs recorded in that
period plus the provision for credit losses and other valuation accounts recognized in that period.
D Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, inclusive of U.S. government securities, U.S. agency
securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and other investment-
grade securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or
Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions.
E Regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2024 are preliminary. The Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and
Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation’s binding ratio was Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach for June 30, 2024 and
March 31, 2024; and the Common equity tier 1 ratio under the Standardized approach for June 30, 2023.
F The below table includes Global Markets sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the
presentation of measures that exclude this item is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational
performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

G In 1Q24, the FDIC increased its estimate of the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature
Bank that will be recouped through the collection of a special assessment from certain insured depository institutions. Accordingly, the Corporation
recorded pretax noninterest expense of $0.7B to increase its accrual for its estimated share of the special assessment. The Corporation has
presented certain non-GAAP financial measures (labeled as “adj.” in the tables below) that exclude the impact of the FDIC special assessment (FDIC
SA) and has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as set forth
below. The Corporation believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures adjusting for the impact of the FDIC SA provides additional information for
evaluating its results of operations and comparing its operational performance between periods by excluding these impacts that may not be
reflective of its underlying operating performance.

For more information and a reconciliation of average tangible common shareholders’ equity to average shareholders’ equity, see page 20.
6 Calculated as noninterest expense divided by revenue, net of interest expense.
H Pretax, pre-provision income (PTPI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting consolidated pretax income to add back provision for
credit losses. Management believes that PTPI is a useful financial measure as it enables an assessment of the Company’s ability to generate
earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle and provides an additional basis for comparing the Company's results of operations between
periods by isolating the impact of provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods. For Reconciliations to GAAP Financial
Measures, see page 20.

Tangible equity ratio (5) 7 .0 7 .0 7 .0
Tangible common equity ratio (5) 6 .2 6 .1 6 .1
(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides
additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation
to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 20.
(2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation.
(3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by
agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate, and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option.
(4) Regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2024 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated against the
lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation’s binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach for
June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024; and Common equity tier 1 ratio under the Standardized approach for June 30, 2023.
(5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end
tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present
measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 20.
Current-period information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation. 16

(1) FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used by management in operating the business that management believes provides investors with
meaningful information on the interest margin for comparative purposes. The Corporation believes that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-
exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income includes FTE adjustments of $318 million and $269 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and
2023, $160 million and $158 million for the second and first quarters of 2024, and $135 million for the second quarter of 2023.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
The Corporation evaluates its business using certain non-GAAP financial measures, including pretax, pre-provision income (as defined in Endnote H on page 11) and ratios that utilize
tangible equity and tangible assets, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and
intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity). Return on average tangible
common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible
common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage
servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities). Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income as a percentage of adjusted average total
shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted
ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In addition, profitability,
relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures defined by GAAP for the six months ended June 30, 2024
and 2023, and the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity
in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently.
