◦ Repurchased 100.5 million shares, or $6.1 billion, of
common stock in second quarter 2024
Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf commented, “Our efforts to transform Wells Fargo were reflected in our second
quarter financial performance as diluted earnings per common share grew from both the first quarter and a year ago. We
continued to see growth in our fee-based revenue offsetting an expected decline in net interest income. The investments
we have been making allowed us to take advantage of the market activity in the quarter with strong performance in
investment advisory, trading, and investment banking fees. Credit performance was consistent with our expectations,
commercial loan demand remained tepid, we saw growth in deposit balances in all of our businesses, and the pace of
customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives slowed.”
“Our capital position remains strong and we continue to use it to support our customers while also prudently returning
excess capital to our shareholders. We repurchased over $12 billion of common stock during the first half of this year and
as we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 14%, subject to approval
by the Company’s Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month.” Scharf added.
“Our risk and control work remains our top priority, and we are also continuing to execute on our strategy to better serve
our customers and drive higher returns over time. In the second quarter we launched two new credit cards, a small
business card and a consumer card. We have now launched nine new cards since 2021, driving strong credit card spend
and account growth. We are investing in our branch network to improve the customer experience including refurbishing
branches and enhancing technology. In our commercial businesses we are investing in talent and technology to capture
the opportunity inherent in our franchise including hiring a new Co-CEO of Corporate and Investment Banking. I’m proud
of the progress we’ve made due to the commitment of everyone who works at Wells Fargo and am excited about the
opportunities ahead,” Scharf concluded.

3 The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).
Second Quarter 2024 vs. Second Quarter 2023
◦ Net interest income decreased 9%, due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs, including the impact of
lower deposit balances and customer migration to higher yielding deposit products in Consumer Banking and Lending
and Wealth and Investment Management, higher deposit costs in Commercial Banking and Corporate and Investment
Banking, as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets
◦ Noninterest income increased 19%, driven primarily by higher trading revenue in our Markets business, higher
investment banking fees, an increase in asset-based fees in Wealth and Investment Management on higher market
valuations, the impact from the adoption of a new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments5,
and improved results from our venture capital investments
◦ Noninterest expense increased 2%, driven by higher operating losses including higher customer remediation accruals for
historical matters, an increase in revenue-related compensation predominantly in Wealth and Investment Management,
and higher technology and equipment expense, partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives including lower
salaries expense and professional and outside services expense
◦ Provision for credit losses in second quarter 2024 included a modest decrease in the allowance for credit losses, as a
higher allowance for credit card loans was more than offset by lower allowances for most other loan portfolios
5
In first quarter 2024, we adopted a new accounting standard to use the proportional amortization method for renewable energy tax credit investments. Under the proportional amortization method, the
amortization of the investments and the related tax impacts are both recognized in income tax expense. Previously, we recognized the amortization of the investments in other noninterest income and
the related tax impacts were recognized in income tax expense.

higher commercial real estate net loan charge-offs, predominantly in the office portfolio, as well as higher commercial
and industrial net loan charge-offs. The consumer net loan charge-off rate increased to 0.88% (annualized), up from
0.84%, due to higher net loan charge-offs in the credit card portfolio, partially offset by lower net loan charge-offs in the
auto portfolio
◦ Nonperforming assets were up $410 million, or 5%, driven by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans,

Forward-Looking Statements
This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and our management may make forward-
looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can
be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,”
“projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular,
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial
performance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our expectations regarding noninterest expense
and our efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses,
our allowance for credit losses, and the economic scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our expectations
regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan
portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or targets; (vii) our expectations regarding our mortgage business and
any related commitments or exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative
developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future common stock dividends, common
share repurchases and other uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on
tangible common equity; (xi) expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such
as legal actions; (xiii) environmental, social and governance related goals or commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans,
objectives and strategies.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements
relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to
predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution
you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact
nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or
risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include the following, without limitation:
• current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high
unemployment rates, declines in commercial real estate prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical
matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth;
• our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;
• current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,
including rules and regulations relating to bank products and financial services;
• our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things,
litigation and regulatory matters;
• the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing
rights and mortgage loans held for sale;
• significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things,
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairment of securities held in our debt securities and equity securities
portfolios;
• the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage
and wealth management businesses;
• developments in our mortgage banking business, including any negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing,
loan modification or foreclosure practices, and any changes in industry standards, regulatory or judicial requirements,
or our strategic plans for the business;
• negative effects from instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal,
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our
reputation;
• regulatory matters, including the failure to resolve outstanding matters on a timely basis and the potential impact of
new matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines,
penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences;
-9-

--- Page 10 ---
• a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks;
• the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;
• fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board;
• changes to tax laws, regulations, and guidance as well as the effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate;
• our ability to develop and execute effective business plans and strategies; and
• the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023.
In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, the impact to our
balance sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements and long-term targeted capital structure, the
results of supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), regulatory and legal
considerations, including regulatory requirements under the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rule, and other factors
deemed relevant by the Company, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.
For additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We
undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future
developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are
unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate
calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent
difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be
significant to future results.
