From Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick:
“Through the team’s hard work, we supported our clients’ growth and drove an improvement in our balance sheet. Liquidity
remained strong and our capital position is well above our new regulatory requirements, which allowed us to return $5.6 billion of
capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. With declines reported on a linked-quarter basis
in consumer credit and commercial real estate losses, asset quality was solid. We believe our diverse business is a source of
strength, helping us deepen existing client relationships and develop new ones, over time.”

Endnotes
A We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (KPIs) that management uses when assessing consolidated and/or segment
results. We believe this information is useful because it provides management and investors with information about underlying operational
performance and trends. KPIs are presented in Consolidated and Business Segment Highlights on page 1, Balance Sheet, Liquidity, and Capital
Highlights on page 9 and on the Segment pages for each segment.
B We also measure NII and revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. FTE basis is a performance
measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors with meaningful information on the interest margin for
comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is
consistent with industry practice. NII on an FTE basis was $14.1 billion, $13.9 billion and $14.5 billion for the three months ended September 30,
2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, was $25.5 billion, $25.5 billion and
$25.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $147
million, $160 million and $153 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
C Reserve build (or release) is calculated by subtracting net charge-offs for the period from the provision for credit losses recognized in that period.
The period-end allowance, or reserve, for credit losses reflects the beginning of the period allowance adjusted for net charge-offs recorded in that
period plus the provision for credit losses and other valuation accounts recognized in that period.
D Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, inclusive of U.S. government securities, U.S. agency
securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and other investment-
grade securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or
Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions.
E Regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2024 are preliminary. The Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and
Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation’s binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach for all periods
presented.
F The below table includes Global Markets sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the
presentation of measures that exclude this item is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational
performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

G Pretax, pre-provision income (PTPI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting consolidated pretax income to add back provision for
credit losses. Management believes that PTPI is a useful financial measure as it enables an assessment of the Company’s ability to generate
earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle and provides an additional basis for comparing the Company's results of operations between
periods by isolating the impact of provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods. For Reconciliations to GAAP Financial
Measures, see page 19.

and reputational damage, which are inherently difficult to predict, resulting from pending, threatened or future litigation and regulatory
investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, of which the Corporation is subject to in the ordinary course of business, including matters
related to our processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, the features of our automatic credit card payment
service, the adequacy of the Corporation’s anti-money laundering and economic sanctions programs, the processing of electronic payments and
related fraud and the rates paid on uninvested cash in investment advisory accounts that is swept into interest-paying bank deposits, which are in
various stages; the possibility that the Corporation's future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss
for litigation, and regulatory and government actions; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties
involved in mortgage securitizations; the Corporation’s ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims; the risks
related to the discontinuation of reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies;

resulting in worsening economic and market volatility, and regulatory responses thereto; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than
currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic
conditions and other uncertainties, including the impact of supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and labor shortages on economic
conditions and our business; potential losses related to the Corporation’s concentration of credit risk; the Corporation's ability to achieve its expense
targets and expectations regarding revenue, net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other
projections; variances to the underlying assumptions and judgments used in estimating banking book net interest income sensitivity; adverse
changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or
borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation’s assets
and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding
the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity
requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and / or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the effect of changes in or interpretations of income tax laws and
regulations; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but
not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary

(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides
additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation
to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 19.
(2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation.
(3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by
agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate, and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option.
(4) Regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2024 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation’s binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized
approach for all periods presented.
(5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end
tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present
measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 19.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
The Corporation evaluates its business using certain non-GAAP financial measures, including pretax, pre-provision income (as defined in Endnote G on page 10) and ratios that utilize
tangible equity and tangible assets, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill
and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity). Return on average
tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity.
The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding
mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities). Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income as a percentage of adjusted
average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share
represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In
addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures defined by GAAP for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial
measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently.
