A We also measure NII and revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. FTE basis is a performance
measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors with meaningful information on the interest margin for
comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is
consistent with industry practice. NII on an FTE basis was $14.5 billion, $14.1 billion, $13.9 billion, $14.2 billion and $14.1 billion for the three
months ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Revenue, net of
interest expense, on an FTE basis, was $25.5 billion, $25.5 billion and $22.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2024, September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $154 million, $147 million and $145 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
B We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (KPIs) that management uses when assessing consolidated and/or segment
results. We believe this information is useful because it provides management and investors with information about underlying operational
performance and trends. KPIs are presented in Consolidated and Business Segment Highlights on page 1, Balance Sheet, Liquidity, and Capital
Highlights on page 9 and on the Segment pages for each segment.
C In 4Q23, the FDIC imposed a special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured
depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank associated with their closures. Accordingly, the Corporation recorded pretax noninterest
expense of $2.1B in 4Q23 for its estimated assessment amount. Additionally, the Corporation recorded a net pretax charge of $1.6B in 4Q23 to
noninterest income related to interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain loans that are indexed to the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank
Yield Index (BSBY) following the 4Q23 announcement that BSBY would permanently cease effective November 15, 2024. The Corporation has
presented certain non-GAAP financial measures (labeled as “adj.” in the tables below) that exclude the impacts of the FDIC special assessment (FDIC
SA) and/or the BSBY charge, and has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures as set forth below. The Corporation believes
the use of non-GAAP financial measures adjusting for the impact of the FDIC SA and the BSBY charge provide additional information for evaluating
its results of operations and comparing its operational performance between periods by excluding these impacts that may not be reflective of its
underlying operating performance.

E Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, inclusive of U.S. government securities, U.S. agency
securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and other investment-
grade securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or
Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions.
F Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2024 are preliminary. The Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and
Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation’s binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach for all periods
presented.
G The below table includes Global Markets sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the
presentation of measures that exclude this item is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational
performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

were ($18) million, ($8) million and ($127) million, and Equities net DVA gains (losses) were ($1) million, $0 and ($5) million, respectively.
H Pretax, pre-provision income (PTPI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting consolidated pretax income to add back provision for
credit losses. Management believes that PTPI is a useful financial measure as it enables an assessment of the Company’s ability to generate
earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle and provides an additional basis for comparing the Company's results of operations between
periods by isolating the impact of provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods. For Reconciliations to GAAP Financial
Measures, see page 20.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks
and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the
Corporation’s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation’s potential judgments, orders, settlements, penalties, fines
and reputational damage, which are inherently difficult to predict, resulting from pending, threatened or future litigation and regulatory
investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, of which the Corporation is subject to in the ordinary course of business, including matters
related to our processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states, the features of our automatic credit card payment
service, the adequacy of the Corporation’s anti-money laundering and economic sanctions programs, the processing of electronic payments and
related fraud and the rates paid on uninvested cash in investment advisory accounts that is swept into interest-paying bank deposits, which are in
various stages; the possibility that the Corporation's future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss
for litigation, and regulatory and government actions; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties
involved in mortgage securitizations; the Corporation’s ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims; the risks
related to the discontinuation of reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies;
uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing

business, financial condition and results of operations; the impact of adverse developments affecting the U.S. or global banking industry, including
bank failures and liquidity concerns, resulting in worsening economic and market volatility, and regulatory responses thereto; the possibility that
future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with
respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties, including the impact of supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and
labor shortages on economic conditions and our business; potential losses related to the Corporation’s concentration of credit risk; the Corporation's
ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding revenue, net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective
tax rate, loan growth or other projections; variances to the underlying assumptions and judgments used in estimating banking book net interest
income sensitivity; adverse changes to the Corporation’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets
or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of
the Corporation’s assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those
standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to
total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and / or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential
impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation’s capital plans; the effect of changes in or
interpretations of income tax laws and regulations; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and
regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

Tangible common equity ratio (5) 6.3 6.2 6.2
(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides
additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation
to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 20.
(2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation.
(3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by
agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate, and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option.
(4) Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2024 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation’s binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized
approach for all periods presented.
(5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end
tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present
measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 20.
Current-period information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation. 16

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
The Corporation evaluates its business using certain non-GAAP financial measures, including pretax, pre-provision income (as defined in Endnote H on page 11) and ratios that utilize
tangible equity and tangible assets, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill
and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity). Return on average
tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity.
The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding
mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities). Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income as a percentage of adjusted
average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share
represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In
addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures defined by GAAP for the years ended December 31,
2024 and 2023, and the three months ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures
provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently.
