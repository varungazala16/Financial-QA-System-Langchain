◦ Repurchased 62 million shares, or $3.5 billion, of
common stock in third quarter 2024
Third quarter 2024 results included:
◦ $(447) million, or $(0.10) per share, of net losses on debt securities related to a repositioning of the investment
securities portfolio
Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf commented, “We had solid results in the third quarter with both net income and diluted
earnings per share up from the second quarter. Our earnings profile is very different than it was five years ago as we have been
making strategic investments in many of our businesses and de-emphasizing or selling others. Our revenue sources are more
diverse and fee-based revenue grew 16% during the first nine months of the year, largely offsetting net interest income
headwinds. We have maintained strong credit discipline and driven significant operating efficiencies in the company while
investing heavily to build a risk and control environment appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity. While we believe
there are significant benefits still to come from our investments, it is gratifying to see our actions having an impact on our
business metrics and financial results.”
“Our strong capital position enables us to continue investing in our businesses and we have consistently returned excess capital
to our shareholders. We increased our third quarter common stock dividend by 14% and repurchased $3.5 billion of common
stock in the third quarter and over $15 billion during the first nine months of this year, up over 60% from a year ago. Our diluted
common share count is down 7% from a year ago and 22% over the last 5 years,” Scharf added.
“While our risk and control work remains our top priority, we continue to invest to drive more diverse and stronger growth and
higher returns. In the third quarter, we launched two new co-branded credit cards and announced a multi-year co-branded
agreement for auto financing. We continued to hire experienced leaders across the Company, including a new Head of
Technology and key coverage and product hires in the Corporate and Investment Bank, and we also continued to enhance our
capabilities and improve how we serve our customers. I am excited about the opportunities ahead to make Wells Fargo even
better for our customers, our employees, and our communities,” Scharf concluded.

3 The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).
Third Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023
◦ Net interest income decreased 11%, due to higher funding costs reflecting customer migration to higher yielding
deposit products, and deposit mix and pricing changes, including increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory
brokerage accounts, as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets
◦ Noninterest income increased 12%, driven by improved results from our venture capital investments, an increase in
asset-based fees in Wealth and Investment Management on higher market valuations, higher investment banking fees,
higher net gains from trading in our Markets business, and higher deposit-related fees, partially offset by net losses on
debt securities related to a repositioning of the investment securities portfolio
◦ Noninterest expense decreased slightly as the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower severance and salaries
expense and a decrease in professional and outside services expense, was largely offset by higher revenue-related
compensation expense predominantly in Wealth and Investment Management and higher technology and equipment
expense
◦ Provision for credit losses in third quarter 2024 included a modest decrease in the allowance for credit losses, reflecting
lower allowances across most loan portfolios, partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans driven by an
increase in balances

Forward-Looking Statements
This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and our management may make forward-
looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can
be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,”
“projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular,
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial
performance of the Company or any of its businesses, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our expectations
regarding noninterest expense and our efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our
expectations regarding future loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic scenarios considered to
develop the allowance; (iv) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (v) loan growth or the
reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or targets; (vii) the expected
outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance
therewith; (viii) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (ix) our targeted
range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (x) expectations regarding our
effective income tax rate; (xi) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal actions; (xii) environmental, social and
governance related goals or commitments; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements
relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to
predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution
you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact
nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or
risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements include the following, without limitation:
• current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high
unemployment rates, declines in commercial real estate prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical
matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth;
• our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;
• current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,
including rules and regulations relating to bank products and financial services;
• our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things,
litigation and regulatory matters;
• the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our
assets or liabilities on our net interest income and net interest margin;
• significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, a
reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, a reduction in our ability to sell or securitize loans,
and declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairment of securities held in our debt securities and equity
securities portfolios;
• the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage
and wealth management businesses;
• negative effects from instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal,
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our
reputation;
• regulatory matters, including the failure to resolve outstanding matters on a timely basis and the potential impact of
new matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines,
penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences;
• a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks;
• the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;
• fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board;
-9-

--- Page 10 ---
• changes to tax laws, regulations, and guidance as well as the effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate;
• our ability to develop and execute effective business plans and strategies; and
• the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023.
In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, the impact to our
balance sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements and long-term targeted capital structure, the
results of supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), regulatory and legal
considerations, including regulatory requirements under the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rule, and other factors
deemed relevant by the Company, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.
For additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
available on its website at www.sec.gov5.
Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We
undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future
developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are
unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate
calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent
difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be
significant to future results.
